  <p>The question is is whether it's from vasculitis or blood thinners.</p>

  <h1>Answer:</h1>
  
  <h2>Pulmonary Hemorrhage in Vasculitis vs Anticoagulation: A Clinical Comparison</h2>

  <h3>Clinical Presentation & Patient History</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vasculitis-Associated Pulmonary Hemorrhage:</strong> Often occurs in patients with an underlying autoimmune disorder or <strong>pulmonary-renal syndrome</strong>. Clues include systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, weight loss), skin purpura, sinus or ear inflammation, and especially concurrent <strong>rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis</strong> (hematuria with RBC casts) (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,%E2%80%93%20more%20on%20this%20below">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>) (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,glycoprotein%20I%20antibody">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). For example, <strong>ANCA-associated vasculitis</strong> (like granulomatosis with polyangiitis) frequently presents with lung hemorrhage plus renal failure and ENT or skin involvement (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,%E2%80%93%20more%20on%20this%20below">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). Patients are often middle-aged, but vasculitic hemorrhage can affect various ages depending on the disease (e.g. Goodpasture's in young adult males, lupus in young women). There is usually <strong>no history of anticoagulant use</strong>; instead, history may reveal known autoimmune disease or recent triggers (e.g. new medications in drug-induced vasculitis).</li>
    <li><strong>Anticoagulation-Associated Pulmonary Hemorrhage:</strong> Typically occurs in patients on <strong>warfarin or DOAC therapy</strong> (e.g. for atrial fibrillation, DVT/PE, mechanical heart valves). History often reveals an older adult with cardiovascular comorbidities or recent thrombosis who was started on anticoagulants. There may be a precipitant such as <strong>excessive anticoagulation</strong> (e.g. supratherapeutic INR or interacting medications/dosing errors) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=The%20patient%27s%20laboratory%20findings%20were,and%20cardiac%20enzymes%2C%20were%20unremarkable">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=compliance%2C%20or%20alcohol%20consumption%20may,the%20treatment%20is%20not%20being">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>). Unlike vasculitis, these patients <strong>lack systemic autoimmune symptoms</strong> – no rash, no arthritis, no sinusitis. If hematuria is present, it is usually due to bleeding (often gross hematuria) <em>without</em> RBC casts (i.e. no glomerulonephritis) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=The%20patient%27s%20laboratory%20findings%20were,and%20cardiac%20enzymes%2C%20were%20unremarkable">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>). Other bleeding signs (easy bruising, epistaxis) may co-exist if coagulopathy is severe. In summary, a patient coughing blood on anticoagulants (especially with high INR or known DOAC use) and no autoimmune features raises suspicion for coagulopathy-induced hemorrhage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) Findings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vasculitis-Related:</strong> BAL in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage will show <strong>increasingly bloody returns</strong> with successive aliquots, confirming intra-alveolar bleeding (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3483562/#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20bronchoscopy%20with,alveolar%20red%20cells%20have">Update on Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage and Pulmonary Vasculitis - PMC</a>). The fluid typically does not clear with irrigation, and cytology or iron stain reveals numerous <strong>hemosiderin-laden macrophages</strong> (siderophages) once bleeding has been ongoing for >48–72 hours (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3483562/#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20bronchoscopy%20with,alveolar%20red%20cells%20have">Update on Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage and Pulmonary Vasculitis - PMC</a>). These findings are characteristic of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage but <strong>not specific to vasculitis</strong> (they occur in any cause of alveolar hemorrhage). BAL is mainly useful to confirm pulmonary hemorrhage and exclude infection; it cannot directly identify vasculitic inflammation. In vasculitic hemorrhage, the BAL return is hemorrhagic just like other causes, though inflammatory cells may be present. Definitive diagnosis requires serologies or biopsy rather than BAL cytology.</li>
    <li><strong>Anticoagulation-Related:</strong> BAL findings are essentially the <strong>same pattern of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage</strong>. The bronchoscopy returns serial aliquots that become more blood-tinged and fail to clear (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6852223/#:~:text=anticoagulants%20irregularly%20since%20then%20without,and%20the%20patient%20has%20been">Warfarin-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Case report and a review of the literature - PMC</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6852223/#:~:text=infiltrates%2C%20whereas%20computed%20tomography%20of,has%20been%20asymptomatic%20since%20then">Warfarin-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Case report and a review of the literature - PMC</a>). Hemosiderin-laden macrophages can be seen if the hemorrhage has been present for some time, indicating prior bleeding (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6852223/#:~:text=infiltrates%2C%20whereas%20computed%20tomography%20of,has%20been%20asymptomatic%20since%20then">Warfarin-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Case report and a review of the literature - PMC</a>). In practice, BAL helps confirm that the hemoptysis is coming from diffuse alveolar bleeding (and not an airway source) in anticoagulated patients. There are no unique BAL markers to distinguish coagulopathy-induced hemorrhage from vasculitis – the context and labs are key. (Cultures on BAL may be done to rule out infection as a trigger, but typically no infectious organisms are found if anticoagulation is the culprit.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Laboratory Findings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vasculitis-Associated:</strong> <strong>Autoimmune serologies</strong> are often positive and are pivotal for diagnosis. For instance, <strong>ANCA</strong> (c-ANCA/PR3 for GPA; p-ANCA/MPO for microscopic polyangiitis) is frequently positive in ANCA-associated vasculitic hemorrhage (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7119931/#:~:text=should%20be%20measured%20to%20assess,of%20DAH%20complicating%20SLE%2C%20the">Alveolar Hemorrhage - PMC</a>). Anti-glomerular basement membrane (<strong>anti-GBM</strong>) antibodies, if positive, confirm Goodpasture's syndrome (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7119931/#:~:text=in%20specific%20cases%2C%20serologic%20studies,such%20as%20granulomatosis%20with">Alveolar Hemorrhage - PMC</a>). Other tests like ANA, anti-dsDNA, low complement levels (C3, C4) may be seen if the hemorrhage is due to lupus or other connective tissue disease (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7119931/#:~:text=should%20be%20measured%20to%20assess,of%20DAH%20complicating%20SLE%2C%20the">Alveolar Hemorrhage - PMC</a>). Inflammatory markers are typically elevated (CRP, ESR); in fact, an ESR >100 mm/hr strongly supports an active vasculitic process, whereas a normal ESR makes vasculitis less likely (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,glycoprotein%20I%20antibody">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). Routine labs often show <strong>anemia</strong> from blood loss (and chronic disease) and possibly acute kidney injury if there is glomerulonephritis. Coagulation studies are usually <em>normal</em> in vasculitis-related hemorrhage (unless there is a coexisting DIC or antiphospholipid syndrome, etc.). <strong>Urinalysis</strong> is very informative: the presence of dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts indicates glomerular bleeding, aligning with vasculitis, whereas vasculitic patients generally won't have coagulopathic bleeding elsewhere (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,glycoprotein%20I%20antibody">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>Anticoagulation-Associated:</strong> The hallmark is an abnormal <strong>coagulation profile</strong>. Warfarin therapy often shows a <strong>high INR</strong> (often >3; case reports describe INR in the 7–10 range during alveolar hemorrhage) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=The%20patient%27s%20laboratory%20findings%20were,and%20cardiac%20enzymes%2C%20were%20unremarkable">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>). For example, one warfarin-treated patient with hemoptysis had an INR ~7.9 at presentation (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=The%20patient%27s%20laboratory%20findings%20were,and%20cardiac%20enzymes%2C%20were%20unremarkable">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>). aPTT may be prolonged if heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors are involved. Platelet count is usually normal (unless the hemorrhage is exacerbated by thrombocytopenia or an underlying condition). <strong>DIC panels</strong> are typically negative unless an underlying disorder exists – in pure anticoagulant overdose, only the targeted pathway is prolonged (e.g. isolated high INR for warfarin). Importantly, <strong>autoimmune serologies are negative</strong> (ANCA, anti-GBM, ANA all absent) (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=thickening%20and%20no%20pulmonary%20embolus,was%20discharged%20home%20without%20anticoagulation">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>). In a reported DOAC-induced hemorrhage, comprehensive rheumatologic workup was entirely negative, supporting a non-immune cause (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=thickening%20and%20no%20pulmonary%20embolus,was%20discharged%20home%20without%20anticoagulation">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>). Inflammatory markers like CRP/ESR may be normal or only mildly elevated (if there's inflammation from hemorrhage or another illness) but not in the extreme ranges typical of vasculitis. <strong>Urinalysis</strong> might show blood (from anticoagulant-related hematuria) but usually <strong>without RBC casts</strong>, differentiating it from vasculitic glomerular disease (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=The%20patient%27s%20laboratory%20findings%20were,and%20cardiac%20enzymes%2C%20were%20unremarkable">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>). In summary, lab evaluation in suspected DAH should check both serologies and coagulation: a <strong>positive ANCA/autoimmune panel vs. a supratherapeutic INR</strong> helps pinpoint the etiology (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,glycoprotein%20I%20antibody">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Imaging Findings (Chest X-ray & CT)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vasculitis-Associated:</strong> Both vasculitis and coagulopathic hemorrhage produce a pattern of <strong>diffuse alveolar infiltrates</strong> on imaging, but vasculitis may have additional clues. Chest X-ray typically shows bilateral <strong>airspace opacities</strong> that can range from patchy ground-glass to confluent consolidation (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,3%20days.%28Fishman%202023">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). A classic pattern is <strong>central (perihilar) distribution</strong> with sparing of the lung periphery and apices (a "bat-wing" appearance), although patterns can vary (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,3%20days.%28Fishman%202023">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). On high-resolution CT, diffuse <strong>ground-glass opacities</strong> are common, reflecting blood filling alveoli (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=Hemoglobin%20dropped%20from%2014%20to,protein%20and%20erythrocyte%20sedimentation%20rate">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>). One hallmark suggesting vasculitis is the presence of <strong>coexisting lung nodules or cavitations</strong>. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, for example, often shows multiple pulmonary nodules (which may cavitate) along with hemorrhagic infiltrates (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,atrium%20may%20suggest%20heart%20failure">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). Such nodules or fixed pulmonary lesions are not expected in a pure coagulopathic hemorrhage. If the vasculitis involves pulmonary capillaries exclusively (e.g. microscopic polyangiitis or isolated pulmonary capillaritis), the imaging may show only the diffuse alveolar infiltrates without nodules. <strong>Pleural effusions</strong> are uncommon in primary pulmonary capillaritis (their presence might suggest an alternate cause like heart failure or lupus). Notably, infiltrates due to hemorrhage tend to <strong>clear rapidly</strong> (over days) once bleeding stops (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,3%20days.%28Fishman%202023">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>) – so resolution of opacities after immunosuppressive therapy can be observed in vasculitic DAH.</li>
    <li><strong>Anticoagulation-Associated:</strong> Imaging in anticoagulant-related hemorrhage shows the typical <strong>diffuse alveolar hemorrhage pattern</strong> as well. Chest X-ray will reveal bilateral patchy infiltrates, often in a central or mid-lung distribution with sparing of the lung periphery (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=Chest%20X,the%20perihilar%20and%20pericardiac%20zones">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>). In one warfarin case, the X-ray showed opacities concentrated in the perihilar regions (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=Chest%20X,the%20perihilar%20and%20pericardiac%20zones">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>). High-resolution CT usually demonstrates <strong>bilateral ground-glass opacities</strong> consistent with blood filling the alveoli (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=Hemoglobin%20dropped%20from%2014%20to,protein%20and%20erythrocyte%20sedimentation%20rate">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>). These opacities may have a patchy lobular distribution and can coalesce; in acute bleeding, some areas may appear as consolidation. A described DOAC-induced hemorrhage case showed patchy ground-glass infiltrates with <strong>peripheral sparing</strong> (again pointing to a central predilection) (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=Hemoglobin%20dropped%20from%2014%20to,protein%20and%20erythrocyte%20sedimentation%20rate">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>). Unlike vasculitis, one would <strong>not expect pulmonary nodules or cavitary lesions</strong> on the CT – the lung architecture should be otherwise normal. The heart size is typically normal on imaging (unless the patient has underlying heart failure as well), and there is usually no significant pleural effusion. As with vasculitic DAH, the infiltrates from anticoagulant-related DAH can improve within a few days once the bleeding is controlled. Re-imaging after correction of coagulopathy often shows drastic clearing of the opacities, confirming they were due to hemorrhage rather than infection.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Histology of pulmonary capillaritis.</strong> In vasculitic pulmonary hemorrhage, lung biopsy classically shows <strong>alveolar capillaritis</strong> – an acute small-vessel vasculitis in the lung. The affected alveolar septal capillaries are infiltrated and destroyed by neutrophils (arrow) with fibrinoid necrosis and nuclear debris in the vessel walls (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7119931/#:~:text=Photomicrograph%20,Jewish%20Health%2C%20Denver%2C%20Colorado%2C%20USA">Alveolar Hemorrhage - PMC</a>). This leads to disruption of the alveolar-capillary basement membranes and leakage of red blood cells into airspaces (often accompanied by fibrin and hemosiderin-laden macrophages). In contrast, <strong>anticoagulation-related hemorrhage</strong> shows <em>bland pulmonary hemorrhage</em>: alveoli filled with blood but <strong>no inflammatory cell infiltrates or necrotic vasculitis</strong> in the vessel walls (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7119931/#:~:text=While%20both%20bland%20pulmonary%20hemorrhage,membrane%20suggesting%20a%20possible%20etiology">Alveolar Hemorrhage - PMC</a>). Thus, on lung biopsy, the presence of capillaritis (vasculitic inflammation) points to an immune cause, whereas its absence (just hemorrhage) points to a coagulopathic or other non-immune cause. Notably, immunofluorescence microscopy can further distinguish subtypes of vasculitis (e.g. linear IgG deposits in anti-GBM disease vs. pauci-immune in ANCA vasculitis), findings not seen in bleeding from anticoagulation.</p>

  <h3>Treatment Response & Clinical Course</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vasculitis-Associated:</strong> These patients require prompt <strong>immunosuppressive therapy</strong> to control the underlying disease. High-dose corticosteroids are the cornerstone of initial treatment, often combined with cyclophosphamide or rituximab for ANCA-associated vasculitis, or plasmapheresis in Goodpasture's (anti-GBM) – interventions aimed at halting the immune attack. Typically, if the diagnosis is made, patients show improvement in oxygenation and decreased hemoptysis after immunosuppressive therapy is started. <strong>Failure to treat the immune cause can be fatal</strong>, as vasculitic pulmonary hemorrhage can progress to respiratory failure. Over time, vasculitis-related hemorrhage can be <em>relapsing</em>. For example, granulomatosis with polyangiitis may flare with recurrent bouts of alveolar bleeding if immunosuppression is tapered too quickly. Recurrent hemorrhage or prolonged inflammation can lead to chronic changes like <strong>pulmonary fibrosis</strong> (with interstitial thickening or honeycombing seen on later imaging) (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). Renal outcomes also depend on timely therapy – concurrent glomerulonephritis may cause permanent kidney damage if not treated. A key point is that vasculitic hemorrhage <strong>responds to immunomodulation</strong>: improvement correlates with controlling the vasculitis (often the chest infiltrates clear after a few days of steroids (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,3%20days.%28Fishman%202023">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>)), whereas mere supportive care without immunosuppression would not stop the bleeding.</li>
    <li><strong>Anticoagulation-Associated:</strong> Management centers on <strong>reversing the coagulopathy</strong>. The offending anticoagulant is immediately discontinued and reversed if possible (e.g. vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrates for warfarin, idarucizumab for dabigatran, etc.) (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=thickening%20and%20no%20pulmonary%20embolus,was%20discharged%20home%20without%20anticoagulation">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6852223/#:~:text=lavage%20yielded%20samples%20which%20became,has%20been%20asymptomatic%20since%20then">Warfarin-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Case report and a review of the literature - PMC</a>). Supportive care (oxygen, mechanical ventilation if needed, transfusions) is provided, but immunosuppressive medications are <em>not</em> indicated since there is no immune-mediated injury. Hemorrhage due to anticoagulation usually abates quickly once clotting parameters normalize. For instance, a patient on rivaroxaban with DAH had complete resolution of hemoptysis after the drug was stopped and coagulation normalized (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=thickening%20and%20no%20pulmonary%20embolus,was%20discharged%20home%20without%20anticoagulation">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>). Similarly, warfarin-associated hemorrhage often improves after vitamin K/FFP administration – one case showed marked clinical recovery and clearing of infiltrates within days of correcting an INR of 7.9 (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6852223/#:~:text=lavage%20yielded%20samples%20which%20became,has%20been%20asymptomatic%20since%20then">Warfarin-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Case report and a review of the literature - PMC</a>). Recurrence can be prevented by avoiding further over-anticoagulation (dosing adjustments or switching medications). These patients generally do not develop chronic lung injury if the bleeding is promptly controlled, since there is no ongoing vasculitic process – the long-term course is favorable once the inciting coagulopathy is addressed. Another clue to the diagnosis is this <strong>treatment response</strong>: bleeding that <strong>halts with correction of coagulopathy alone</strong> (with no immunotherapy) indicates a non-immune cause. In contrast, vasculitic hemorrhage would persist or worsen unless immunosuppressives are given.</li>

Inflammatory markers typically not markedly elevated. Possible thrombocytopenia or other coagulopathy contributing, but often isolated to the medication's effect. <strong>D-dimer</strong> may be elevated due to hemorrhage but not specific. Anemia is acute from hemorrhage.</td>

      <td>Imaging (CXR)</td>
      <td><strong>Bilateral diffuse infiltrates</strong>. Often <strong>central/perihilar opacities</strong> with sparing of lung periphery and apices (batwing pattern) (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,3%20days.%28Fishman%202023">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). Opacities can range from ground-glass to consolidation, and they often correspond to areas of hemorrhage. Sometimes, <strong>nodules or masses</strong> are present (if granulomatous vasculitis like GPA) in addition to diffuse infiltrates (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,atrium%20may%20suggest%20heart%20failure">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). These nodules may cavitate.</td>
      <td><strong>Bilateral diffuse infiltrates</strong> due to DAH, often <strong>patchy</strong> and sometimes mid- or perihilar predominant (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=Chest%20X,the%20perihilar%20and%20pericardiac%20zones">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>). Imaging usually <strong>lacks nodules</strong> or cavities (pure hemorrhage). Heart size is normal (not cardiogenic edema). No specific focal lesion; just an alveolar filling pattern. The infiltrates can resemble those of vasculitis or even pulmonary edema, so clinical correlation is essential.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Imaging (CT)</td>
      <td><strong>Diffuse ground-glass opacities</strong> (from alveolar blood) often with patchy consolidation (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=Hemoglobin%20dropped%20from%2014%20to,protein%20and%20erythrocyte%20sedimentation%20rate">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>). In acute phase, "dark bronchus sign" (air bronchograms against hemorrhagic background) may be seen. <strong>Additional findings</strong> can suggest vasculitis: e.g. <em>cavitating nodules, airway stenoses</em> (with GPA) (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,atrium%20may%20suggest%20heart%20failure">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>), or concurrent sinus opacifications (if sinus CT done). No enlargement of left atrium (rules out cardiogenic causes) (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,atrium%20may%20suggest%20heart%20failure">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). Septal lines and "crazy-paving" can develop after a couple days as blood organizes.</td>
      <td><strong>Ground-glass opacities</strong> and consolidations as well, reflecting alveolar blood. Often diffuse and bilateral. A notable feature can be <strong>peripheral sparing</strong> – hemorrhage more central, which can be seen as clear subpleural rims on CT (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=Hemoglobin%20dropped%20from%2014%20to,protein%20and%20erythrocyte%20sedimentation%20rate">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>). No vasculitic lesions like granulomas. If the patient aspirated blood or had an underlying condition, there might be dependent opacities, but generally the pattern is similar to any DAH. Lesions resolve quickly after hemorrhage stops, with follow-up CT often normal.</td>

      <td>Histopathology</td>
      <td><strong>Pulmonary capillaritis</strong>: small-vessel vasculitis in lung tissue. Histology shows neutrophils infiltrating alveolar capillary walls with fibrinoid necrosis and fragmented nuclei (leukocytoclastic debris) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7119931/#:~:text=Photomicrograph%20,Jewish%20Health%2C%20Denver%2C%20Colorado%2C%20USA">Alveolar Hemorrhage - PMC</a>). RBCs fill alveoli along with hemosiderin macrophages; immunoglobulin deposition may be seen in immune-complex vasculitis (pauci-immune in ANCA, linear IgG in anti-GBM). A lung or kidney biopsy can confirm the diagnosis (renal biopsy often shows pauci-immune GN if ANCA+).</td>
      <td><strong>Bland hemorrhage</strong>: intra-alveolar blood without vasculitis. Alveolar walls are <strong>free of inflammatory infiltrate</strong> or necrosis (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7119931/#:~:text=While%20both%20bland%20pulmonary%20hemorrhage,membrane%20suggesting%20a%20possible%20etiology">Alveolar Hemorrhage - PMC</a>). Essentially, the architecture is intact aside from blood flooding the alveoli. No immune complexes or vessel inflammation on biopsy. (In practice, biopsy is seldom needed if coagulopathy is evident, but if done, it shows hemorrhage only.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Treatment & Response</td>
      <td><strong>Immunosuppression is required.</strong> High-dose corticosteroids usually lead to improvement in oxygenation and stop further bleeding. Cyclophosphamide or rituximab are added for ANCA vasculitis; plasmapheresis for Goodpasture's or severe cases. With treatment, hemoptysis and infiltrates improve over days. If only supportive care is given, hemorrhage usually continues or recurs because the underlying vasculitis persists. Relapses are common without maintenance therapy, and repeated hemorrhages can cause fibrosis (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>).</td>
      <td><strong>Reverse the coagulopathy.</strong> Stop anticoagulant, administer antidotes (vitamin K, PCC, protamine, etc.) and supportive care (O₂, ventilation, transfusions). This typically results in rapid resolution of bleeding – often within 24-48 hours the hemoptysis stops and the chest infiltrates begin clearing (<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(21)02521-6/fulltext#:~:text=thickening%20and%20no%20pulmonary%20embolus,was%20discharged%20home%20without%20anticoagulation">DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE RESULTING FROM RIVAROXABAN USE: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITHOUT PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS - CHEST</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6852223/#:~:text=lavage%20yielded%20samples%20which%20became,has%20been%20asymptomatic%20since%20then">Warfarin-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Case report and a review of the literature - PMC</a>). No immunosuppressive therapy is needed (and would be ineffective for the bleeding cause). Once stable, decide if anticoagulation can be resumed at a safer level or if an alternative is needed. Recurrence is avoided by managing anticoagulation intensity; there's no intrinsic disease causing ongoing lung injury once coags are corrected.</td>

  <h3>Key Diagnostic Pearls</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome:</strong> The combination of diffuse lung hemorrhage with <strong>glomerulonephritis (RBC casts)</strong> strongly favors an immune vasculitis cause (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,%E2%80%93%20more%20on%20this%20below">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). Coagulopathy may cause hematuria, but typically <em>without</em> RBC casts (no glomerular injury) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=The%20patient%27s%20laboratory%20findings%20were,and%20cardiac%20enzymes%2C%20were%20unremarkable">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>Autoimmune Markers vs Coags:</strong> A <strong>positive ANCA or anti-GBM</strong> (or other autoantibodies) in the setting of DAH points to vasculitis, whereas a <strong>supratherapeutic INR or abnormal coagulation panel</strong> indicates anticoagulation-related hemorrhage (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,glycoprotein%20I%20antibody">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4549538/#:~:text=The%20patient%27s%20laboratory%20findings%20were,and%20cardiac%20enzymes%2C%20were%20unremarkable">Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Associated with Warfarin Therapy - PMC</a>). Likewise, very high ESR/CRP support vasculitis, while a normal ESR argues against it (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,glycoprotein%20I%20antibody">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging Clues:</strong> Diffuse infiltrates occur in both, but <strong>nodules or cavitary lesions</strong> on lung imaging suggest a vasculitic process (e.g. GPA) (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,atrium%20may%20suggest%20heart%20failure">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>). Pure anticoagulant-induced hemorrhage generally shows only diffuse ground-glass opacities/consolidation without focal masses. Rapid clearing of infiltrates after therapy is characteristic of hemorrhage (in both scenarios) and helps differentiate hemorrhage from infectious pneumonia (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,3%20days.%28Fishman%202023">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>Histology:</strong> If a lung biopsy shows <strong>capillaritis</strong> (neutrophilic infiltration and vessel wall necrosis), the hemorrhage is due to vasculitis; if it shows only blood (bland hemorrhage) with no vascular inflammation, a coagulopathic or other non-immune cause is likely (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7119931/#:~:text=While%20both%20bland%20pulmonary%20hemorrhage,membrane%20suggesting%20a%20possible%20etiology">Alveolar Hemorrhage - PMC</a>). Renal biopsy can also aid: a pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis would confirm ANCA vasculitis, whereas a normal kidney biopsy in a bleeding patient might steer toward a coagulopathic etiology.</li>
    <li><strong>Therapeutic Response:</strong> Stopping the bleeding with <strong>immunosuppressives</strong> (steroids, cyclophosphamide) is a telltale of vasculitic DAH – these patients often require prolonged immunotherapy to prevent relapse. In contrast, if the hemorrhage <strong>resolves promptly with anticoagulation reversal alone</strong> (no immunotherapy needed), it was due to the anticoagulant. Always correct coagulopathy in DAH (it can exacerbate any hemorrhage) (<a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/dah/#:~:text=,failure%2C%20coagulopathy%20may%20exacerbate%20that">Pulmonary vasculitis & diffuse alveolar hemorrhage - EMCrit Project</a>), but remember that only the vasculitis cases demand immune-directed treatment.</li>
